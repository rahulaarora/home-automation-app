## API in keys.py

You will need to create your own keys.py file and include your API information.

* [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/)
  * variables: weather_key = api key, city = your city, state = your state
* If you want to connect to a specific Google Calendar (other than your primary one) you will need to grab the calendar's ID from it's settings.
  * variable: cal_key = calendar id

## Weather API

Create an account at [Open Weathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get an API key. Add the key to your keys.py file. You can find the docs [here](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) for the specific API connection being used.

## Google Calendar API

Complete step 1 from [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python?authuser=1). Make sure you are logged in with the Google account you want to use.

Download your credentials (file should be called credentials.json) and add the file to your directory and to your .gitignore file.

## Todos and Grocery List

Both the Todos and Grocery list are using [Peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/) to create  a SQLite database.
